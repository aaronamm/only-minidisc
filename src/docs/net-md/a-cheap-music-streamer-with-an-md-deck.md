## Main idea
- Use a Google Chromecast Audio device to get digital input to an MD deck.
- Use **DAC** in an MD deck to get analog output.
- On an MD deck, select digital input. Press record on it and start playing a source. No need to insert an MD.
  The display shows "XX -DA", indicating that the unit's DAC is in use.

## Supported MD decks
- Here are some tips to help you identify if we can use a deck as DAC.
  - All Sony MD decks support this feature, just press REC and no need to insert a disc.
  - For other brands, they must have something like **EXT MONITOR** button to support this feature.
    If a model does not have **EXT MONITOR**, we need to insert a disc, press **REC** and **PAUSE** buttons but a disc is still running which is not what we expect.

the Denon deck which has **EXT MONITOR** button
